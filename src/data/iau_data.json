The Medieval Latin translator of the Arabic Almagest, in turn, did not recognize any Greek word behind urnis (or whatever Arabic corruption he may have read), so he merely transliterated it into a form which appeared int he manuscripts variously as eurisim, eirisun, eirism, etc. In a note appended to this Medieval Latin constellation name for Cygnus, one Latin commentator ventured to derive it from the name of an aromatic herb he knew: ireus. This erroneous commentary read, in brief part: \"eirisim...ab ireo\", or, \"[the constellation name] eirisim...[coming] from [the word] ireus\". Apparently in one manuscript of the Latin Almagest, the final word of this commentary, ab ireo, were written on the next line below the constellation title, where the descriptions of the stars begin. Since the first star entered in the Almagest under the constellation Cygnus is β Cyg, the words ab ireo seem to have been confused as a name for this star. \"Arabicized\" with the insertion of the letter \"l\", ab ireo, written as \"Albireo\", was applied as a star name to β Cyg by Renaissance times.",

    "Origin": "Applied to α Cep since medieval times.

Firstly, in the Almagest, α Cep is described on the right \"shoulder\" (Arabic al-katif or al-mankib) of Cepheus, whereas no right \"forearm\" (al-dhira<) is described for the figure. Secondly, in Arabic, \"right forearm\" is spelled correctly as al-dhira al-yumna, which (in contrast to al-yamin) lacks assonance in the last syllable to Alderamin. Therefore, it is more likely that Alderamin is derived from the various medieval Western abbreviations of muqaddam al-dhira<ain, \"the Preceding One of the Two Cubits, or Forearms,\" which was a sci-A name (based on ind-A) for α Gem.

    "Origin": "Ultimately from its ind-A name al-jaun, \"the Black Horse, or Bull,\" which became corrupted even in Arabic sources (where some of the corruptions carried other meanings). For example, in the Arabic manuscript of the Almagest that was translated into Latin in 1175 A.D., this name of ε UMa had apparently been miswritten as al-jauza or al-jauza (the latter being identical to the sci-A name for Orion and Gemini). Whatever was read in this Arabic manuscript was transliterated into Latin as alioze. In subsequent Latin copies, this name was further corrupted to aliore, Alcor, Alioth, etc. Since late medieval times, \"Alioth\" became the preferred name for ε UMa.",

To emphasize that it was his own creation, Hevelius dedicated Figure L to the pair, shown as a detail in Fig. 3.1. In atlases published before Hevelius, its stars are shown simply marking the flow of the Milky Way through the area. Ian Ridpath (1989) noted that “Hevelius placed the fox near two other hunting animals, the eagle (the constellation Aquila) and the vulture (which was an alternative identification for Lyra). He explained that the fox was taking the goose to neighbouring Cerberus, another of his inventions.”unnamed before.",

Thus by Renaissance times both the \"y\" and \"d\" of the first part of the ind-A name had become corrupted.) The ind-A asterism al-jauza' was a feminine figure represented in the stars of what is today Orion. The origin of its name is unclear (as with nearly all of the ancient group of ind-A names). The root jwz can mean \"middle,\" and the word al-jauza' is structured as a feminine adjective, thus al-jauza' may mean \"the female one, having something about her related to the middle.\" There have been different speculations as to what the \"middle\" reference, if that is what it is, could be (for one example). The ind-Arabs' al-jauza' corresponded to what in other cultures was Gemini among the zodiacal signs. The sci-Arabs subsequently used the indigenous name for both the Greek Orion and Twins, leading to some confusion in star names between the two constellations. An alternative sci-A name for Orion was al-jabbar, \"the Giant\" and for Gemini, al-taw'aman, \"the Twins.",

He was followed by his sister al-'abur who \"crossed over\" the Milky Way (where the two stars now lie in the southern sky). Meanwhile suhail's second sister, al-ghumaisa, was left alone north of the Milky Way, weeping, until her \"eyes became bleary.\" (The ind-A name for α CMa was al-shi'ra, of unknown meaning.

In Renaissance times, the derivation of alascha was erroneously attributed to the Arabic word las'a, \"sting, or bite (of a poisonous animal),\" rather than to al-latkha.

Subsequent Arabs attempted to identify this fictitious lance with actual stars, sometimes saying it was η Boo with nearby stars, sometimes saying it was \"η Boo alone\" (where \"alone\", in arabic, is written mufradan). From these discussions came, with a slight copying mistake in the Arabic, the erroneous Arabic name mufrad al-ramih, roughly translating as \"the Isolated Single One of the Lance-Bearer\".

Unurgunite is an ancestral jacky lizard who has two wives, represented by stars on either side of him (δ CMa and ε CMa). The Moon is Mityan, the quoll. Mityan fell in love with one of the wives of Unurgunite and tried to lure her away. Unurgunite discovered Mityan’s trickery and attacked him, leading to a great fight in which Mityan was defeated. The Moon has been wandering the heavens ever since, the scars of the battle still visible on his face as maria. One of the wives (δ CMa) lies further away from Unurgunite and is closer to the Moon than the other wife (ε CMa). This is the wife Mityan tried to lure away.",
